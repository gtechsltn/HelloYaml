# HTTP POST request

<pre>
When you make a POST request, you have to encode the data that forms the body of the request in some way.

HTML forms provide three methods of encoding.

application/x-www-form-urlencoded (the default)
multipart/form-data
text/plain

Work was being done on adding application/json, but that has been abandoned.

(Other encodings are possible with HTTP requests generated using other means than an HTML form submission. JSON is a common format for use with web services and some still use SOAP.)


The specifics of the formats don't matter to most developers. The important points are:
Never use text/plain.

When you are writing client-side code:
use multipart/form-data when your form includes any <input type="file"> elements
otherwise you can use multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded but application/x-www-form-urlencoded will be more efficient
